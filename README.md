# MovieTracker
Web Application for tracking and web watching personally owned movies.
I'm thinking it was around 2014, maybe a little earlier. I wanted to create a way to keep track of movies that I owned (digital copies).
I wanted to be able to track what I owned and details about them. I also wanted to me able to watch them in a web browser. 
I gave up my static IP address at home and that really put an end to me hosting applications at home. So this application hasn't been used in a while.
I ended up going with Plex to host and track my movies. I liked my app, but plex has apps for devices and TVs. 
The code is old and yes, there is CSS and JavaScript in the html files, but it was faster to create, especially back then and I just never got to moving everything to separate files.
